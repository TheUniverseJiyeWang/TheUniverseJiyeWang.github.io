# Who Am I

>At this time, looking back to my previous life, I found it hard to define who I am. The most frequent thing I did in my life is stepping out of comfortable zone. Generally, I'm a passionate and creative guy, who can easily fall in love with what I'm currently working on. So here I am, a designer, an advertising strategy expert, a teacher, a script and novel writer, a data analyst and a software engineer. Overall, a happy SLASH.

# Fun Facts about Me

#### Snow Mountains

I've climbed five snow mountains for over ten times in Shangri-la and Tibet. But I failed in becoming a **Sorcerer**. Guess I just don't get the talent.

#### Karaoke

If I choose piano or music composition as a major, I would be a **singer** today and I'm serious. Now I just sing karaoke.

#### Bird Watching

I love watch birds in the early morning when there is no one in the park. But a lot of guys told me that's a retired man's stuff. Guess I'm possessed by an old soul. By the way, my favorite band is **THE EAGLES**, another way to watch birds lol.

# A Bit Personal History

#### Start As A Designer

I studied Industrial Design and designed wooden toys in start-up after graduation. We talked about problem-solving, user-centered and story-telling all day and had a fun time. But then I realized that designer is not actually that crucial especially for the whole brand. So I dicided to move on to another career.

#### Advertising and Marketing Career

In 2016, I got an offer in an excellent advertising and strategy company. And in the next one and a half years, we produced successful campaigns and events for large companies such as HP, Philips and Sigma. We also developed several membership systems and online analysis processing systems for them and that inspired me of how important the data is. I started to prepare for pursuing further education.

#### And Now

Currently I'm studying data analysis and computer science. It's really fascinating to find some meaningful points in a large amount of numbers and texts. Building a website or application is also intriguing, full of the sense of accomplishment. The best part is I can also take great use of my creativity and presentation skills in this field.
