# Who Am I

>At this time, looking back to my previous life, I found it hard to define who I am. The most frequent thing I did in my life is stepping out of comfortable zone. Generally, I'm a passionate and creative guy, who can easily fall in love with what I'm currently working on. So here I am, a designer, an advertising strategy expert, a teacher, a script and novel writer, a data analyst and a software engineer. Overall, a happy SLASH.

# Fun Facts about Me

#### Snow Mountains

I've climbed five snow mountains for over ten times in Shangri-la and Tibet. But I failed in becoming a **Sorcerer**. Guess I just don't get the talent.

#### Karaoke

If I choose piano or music composition as a major, I would be a **singer** today and I'm serious. Now I just sing karaoke.

#### Bird Watching

I love watch birds in the early morning when there is no one in the park. But a lot of guys told me that's a retired man's stuff. Guess I'm possessed by an old soul. By the way, my favorite band is **THE EAGLES**, another way to watch birds lol.
